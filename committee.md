![smiley](./assets/imgs/abdallah.jpg){:height="80px" width="80px"} &nbsp; **Abdallah El Ali**{:style="color: black"} - CWI, Amsterdam

Abdallah El Ali is a tenure-track researcher at the [Distributed & Interactive Systems](https://www.dis.cwi.nl/) group at [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)](https://www.cwi.nl/) in the Netherlands. His research focuses on focuses on human activity sensing and recognition, mobile and wearable interaction techniques, and multimodal interaction, unified by the goal of further understanding human behavior and emotion. He combines advances in HCI and machine learning to enable pervasive affect sensing in and beyond mobile interactions. Website: [https://abdoelali.com/](https://abdoelali.com/){:target="\_blank"}

Mariam Hassib is a postdoctoral researcher at the Bundeswehr University Munich in Germany. Her research interests are Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), and Physiological Computing. She is working on building systems which provide feedback and adapt to the cognitive and affective states of users. She leverages the current ubiquity of BCI devices and wearable physiological sensors to create new tools that support cognitive-awareness outside the lab environment.
