Jeffrey Girard is an assistant professor at the University of Kansas in the department of psychology. He studies how emotions are expressed through verbal and nonverbal behaviour, as well as how interpersonal communication is influenced by individual differences (e.g., personality and mental health) and social factors (e.g., culture and context). His work draws insights and tools from various areas of social science, computer science, statistics, and medicine. Website: [https://jmgirard.com/](https://jmgirard.com/){:target="\_blank"}

![smiley](./assets/imgs/Johannes.jpeg){:height="80px" width="80px"} &nbsp; **Johannes Schirm**{:style="color: black"} - NAIST, Japan

Johannes Schirm is a Ph.D. candidate at the Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan. After studying applied computer science and graphics with a focus on video games, he specialised on virtual reality research. Currently, he examines physiological data like eye tracking, EMG and head movements for their potential of more objectively evaluating the illusion of "presence" in virtual reality, a quale which is most commonly assessed using questionnaires only.
