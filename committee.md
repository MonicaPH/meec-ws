Mariam Hassib is a postdoctoral researcher at the Bundeswehr University Munich in Germany. Her research interests are Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), and Physiological Computing. She is working on building systems which provide feedback and adapt to the cognitive and affective states of users. She leverages the current ubiquity of BCI devices and wearable physiological sensors to create new tools that support cognitive-awareness outside the lab environment.
