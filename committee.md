![smiley](./assets/imgs/abdallah.jpg){:height="80px" width="80px"} &nbsp; **Abdallah El Ali**{:style="color: black"} - CWI, Amsterdam

Abdallah El Ali is a tenure-track researcher at the [Distributed & Interactive Systems](https://www.dis.cwi.nl/) group at [Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)](https://www.cwi.nl/) in the Netherlands. His research focuses on focuses on human activity sensing and recognition, mobile and wearable interaction techniques, and multimodal interaction, unified by the goal of further understanding human behavior and emotion. He combines advances in HCI and machine learning to enable pervasive affect sensing in and beyond mobile interactions. Website: [https://abdoelali.com/](https://abdoelali.com/){:target="\_blank"}

![smiley](./assets/imgs/pete.jpg){:height="80px" width="80px"} &nbsp;&nbsp; **Pete Denman**{:style="color: black"} - Intel, USA

Pete Denman is a Senior Designer developing exploratory prototypes in "Labs" at Intel Corp. Focus on capturing emotion in daily life. He guides ideas through the design process, working with developers, engineers, and ethnographic researchers to create future technologies. Known best for being the lead designer at Intel for famed physicist Stephen Hawking's speech software, Denman could relate to Hawking's circumstances more than most due to his disability. Pete has a passion for connecting the areas of disabilities and learning/education with technology. Denman's current work focuses on affective computing and robots.

Yomna Abdelrahman is a postdoctoral researcher at the Bundeswehr University Munich in Germany. Her research focuses on Thermal Imaging operating in the far-infrared spectrum, novel interactive systems, engagement sensing and adaptive bio-sensor assistive systems. Recently, her research focus shifted to affective computing using thermal cameras as unobtrusive sensor.

Mariam Hassib is a postdoctoral researcher at the Bundeswehr University Munich in Germany. Her research interests are Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), and Physiological Computing. She is working on building systems which provide feedback and adapt to the cognitive and affective states of users. She leverages the current ubiquity of BCI devices and wearable physiological sensors to create new tools that support cognitive-awareness outside the lab environment.
