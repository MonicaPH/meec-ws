<!-- {::options auto_ids="false" /} -->

To train machines to detect and recognise human emotions sensibly, we need valid emotion ground truths that consider dynamic changes over time. A fundamental challenge here is the momentary emotion elicitation and capture (MEEC) from groups and individuals continuously and in real-time, without adversely affecting user experience. In this half-day virtual ACII 2022 workshop, we will (1) have a keynote presentation about ambulatory sampling methods by Prof. Ulrich Ebner-Priemer from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology; (2) have participant talks showcasing their submissions; (3) brainstorm on techniques to understand dynamic changes given different temporal measurement resolutions; and (4) create a battery of methods relevant to diverse affective contexts.

We seek contributions across disciplines that explore how emotions can be naturally elicited and captured in the moment. Topics include:

**Elicitation:**
* multi-modal (e.g., film, music) and multi-sensory (e.g., smell, taste, thermal) elicitation
* emotion elicitation across domains (e.g., automotive, healthcare)
* elicitation and immersiveness (e.g., AR/VR)
* elicitation over time (e.g., mood)
* ethical considerations

**Capture:**
* emotion models (dimensional, discrete)
* annotation modalities (e.g., speech, gestures) and tools (e.g., questionnaires, ESMs)
* devices (e.g., mobile, wearable) and sensors (e.g., RGB / thermal cameras, EEG, eye tracking)
* attention considerations (e.g., interruptions)
* ethical issues in tracking and detection


## How to Participate

We invite position papers, research results papers, and demos (2-9 pages, including references) that describe/showcase emotion elicitation and/or capture methods. Submissions will be peer-reviewed by two peers and selected on their potential to spark discussion. Submissions should be prepared according to the IEEE conference template and submitted in PDF through Easychair. Accepted submissions will be made available on the workshop proceedings of ACII2022. At least one author must register for the workshop and one day of the conference, with (TBD) special rates for remote attendance.
