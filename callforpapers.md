To train machines to sensibly detect and recognize human emotions, we need valid emotion ground truths. A fundamental challenge here is the momentary emotion elicitation and capture (MEEC) from individuals continuously and in real-time, without adversely affecting user experience. In this one-day CHI 2020 workshop, we will (a) explore and define novel elicitation tasks (b) survey sensing and annotation techniques (c) create a taxonomy of when and where to apply an elicitation method.

We seek contributions across disciplines that explore how emotions can be naturally elicited and captured in the moment. Topics include:

**Elicitation:**
* multi-modal (e.g., film, music) and multi-sensory (e.g., auditory, taste, olfactory) elicitation
* emotion elicitation across domains (e.g., automotive, healthcare)
* elicitation and immersiveness (e.g., AR, VR)
* elicitation over time (e.g., mood)
* ethical considerations

**Capture:**
* emotion models (dimensional, discrete)
* annotation modalities (e.g., speech, gestures) and tools (e.g., questionnaires, ESMs)
* devices (e.g., mobile, wearable) and sensors (e.g., RGB / thermal cameras, EEG)
* attention considerations (e.g., interruptions)


## How to Participate
We invite position papers, posters, and demos that present emotion elicitation and/or capture methods. Submissions will be selected on their potential to spark discussion by two peer-reviewers in a single blind process. Submissions must include author names, and have a length of 2-8 pages, including references. Submissions should be in the [SIGCHI Extended Abstracts](https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/){:target="\_blank"} format and submitted in PDF through [Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=meec2020){:target="\_blank"}. Accepted submissions will be made available on the workshop website. At least one author must register for the workshop and one day of the conference.
